Was watching dnrTV:194 the other day with Steve Smith on Commonly Used Design Patterns. He explained the 4 stages of learning a design pattern and I would like to share that here.

##Stage 0 - Ignorance
You used what? Never heard of it.

##Stage 1 - Awakening
Wow, I just learned how XYZ pattern can improve my design. I'm not really sure where it would work in my code, but I'm definitely looking.

##Stage 2 - Overzealous
I totally "get" the XYZ pattern; I'm adding it everywhere I can shoehorn it into m code. My design's gonna be better now, for sure!

##Stage 3 - Mastery
After allowing the design to evolve through interaction with the users and the addition of tests, it started to exhibit ABC negative characteristics, but the XYZ pattern was a logical next step and was achieved through a simple refactoring.
