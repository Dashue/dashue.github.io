Having tried hosting my blog on tumblr, my own wordpress instance and wordpress online I've never been really happy. To me, writing should be simple and easy, so when I first heard of Sandra.Snow: A solution to freely host your blog on github pages with full control over everything, I jumped on it!

First thing I had to do was migrate my original posts (html) off of wordpress. The other people using Sandra.Snow that I know of created a Wordpress export file and manually started to migrate posts over. I on the other hand claimed "Why spend 2 hours of manual labour when I can spend two weeks to automate the process". In hindsight not the best approach :) , but from it were two open source solutions born:


[Html To Markdown.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlToMarkdown.Net/)  *(Apparently this didnÂ´t exist already)*   
[From Wordpress To Sandra.Snow](https://github.com/Dashue/FromWordpressToSandraSnow)

So in the following days I will continue to sanity-check old posts and publish them here.
