Ubiquitous language: geeks and suites can talk. Created by terms and definitions

Bounded contexts: Domain is big, partitions are needed. Contexts are scopes and terms/features can be in scope or out of scope. Helps to partition what to build in isolation without having to model the whole domain up front.

Entity: Has Identity and lifecycle

Value object: Sum of all its values: DateOfBirth is day month year, but no identity A for a particular birth. It&#8217;s always attached to an entity.
