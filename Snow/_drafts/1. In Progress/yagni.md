People use it without having read the definition, because it&#8217;s one of those terms you think understand right away &#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to need it&#8221; surely must mean I can say this when I don&#8217;t need to have something?

The reason for this post is because more and more people are starting to use YAGNI thinking it&#8217;s the only reason required against something. If they cannot find any other argument than YAGNI, then it&#8217;s probably not YAGNI. Its is a good argument, but not in itself. It is not a veto expression, more arguments needs to be provided.

Too many developers are fast to throw abbreviations as arguments thinking they are valid just because it accidentally fits right this instance.

YAGNI right at this moment, but if we need it in a near future and the cost of change later would be massive.

He said YAGNI (an abbreviation), which puts me off by implying i&#8217;m doing more than I need and over complicating thing and thereby not have the great enough knowledge of the requirements of the system.

YAGNI shouldn&#8217;t override good practices but if often does. Splitting project, yagni, creating layers, yagni.

What about seperation, maintainability etc. Just because it&#8217;s not needed right now doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s yagni. postponing refactors and best practices and until you need them will cost you.

YAGNI shouldn&#8217;t be used for arguing that You Don&#8217;t Need It Right Now.

**Per definition it is:**

_**&#8220;**programmers should not add functionality until it is necessary &#8221;_ or  
_"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."_

Which doesn&#8217;t say anything of keeping open for possiblity additions in the future.

Don&#8217;t forget that per definition the term applies to features, not implementation details, architecture or anything else.

Summary, never build yourself into a corner just because you don't need the functionality right now.
