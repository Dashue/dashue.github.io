Is not
 - The most imperative solution
- The most stupid solution
- The first thing you get to work
- The least complexed solution

What it is:
- The most maintainable
- The least risk for bugs
- The most extendable
- Most testable


Examples
- Generics IOC binding
- Dictionary key value, instead of switch
- Infrastructure to enable extensibility


Instead of Simplicity, Simplest, KISS, should be most appropriate
