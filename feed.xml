&lt;p&gt;Having tried hosting my blog on tumblr, my own wordpress instance and wordpress online I've never been really happy. To me, writing should be simple and easy, so when I first heard of Sandra.Snow: A solution to freely host your blog on github pages with full control over everything, I jumped on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I had to do was migrate my original posts (html) off of wordpress. The other people using Sandra.Snow that I know of created a Wordpress export file and manually started to migrate posts over. I on the other hand claimed "Why spend 2 hours of manual labour when I can spend two weeks to automate the process". In hindsight not the best approach :) , but from it were two open source solutions born:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlToMarkdown.Net/"&gt;Html To Markdown.Net&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;em&gt;(Apparently this didn´t exist already)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Dashue/FromWordpressToSandraSnow"&gt;From Wordpress To Sandra.Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the following days I will continue to sanity-check old posts and publish them here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow"&gt;Fork from here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled upon Enumerable.Zip which is a newly added Linq operator since .NET Framework 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signature is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;TResult&amp;gt; Zip&amp;lt;TFirst, TSecond, TResult&amp;gt;(
    this IEnumerable&amp;lt;TFirst&amp;gt; first,
    IEnumerable&amp;lt;TSecond&amp;gt; second,
    Func&amp;lt;TFirst, TSecond, TResult&amp;gt; func);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like a zipper it "zips" together two IEnumerables applying a specified function over each pair of elements.
I've seen examples which print the greater number from two list of ints, which constructs addresses from four lists of city/street/number/flatnumber and one that prints name and age from name/age lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have as of yet found a good real world example, and am incapable of thinking one up.&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone out there who have made good use of this added functionality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine asked me to share my thoughts on the ref keyword so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give it some context: To me a good method is a function taking a variable amount of parameters, making some processing and possibly returning the result. Furthermore the method should do one thing and one thing only and never change input parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the ref keyword allow developers to stray from this "ideal" method by allowing it to change the values of the input parameters. Obfuscating the self-documentation of the method and by this diffusing what the method does and what it's single responsibility is. This creates a required understanding by your fellow colleagues about the intricates of the method, and in turn requires every developer to know how every method in the system is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common reason for using ref parameters is simply that your method is doing to much, rendering you unable to return a single value/collection to account for everything that is being done, ending up with sending and object as input parameter and changing a lot of values. This may be improved by returning part of the data as an out parameter and part of it as the return value if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I think that using out is better than ref is because out doesn't obfuscate the api and the intention of the method. Using Ref conveys that "This method might(?) change values of the parameter or even the parameter itself" while Out conveys that "This method will change the parameter".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider these two implementations of this contrived example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Example 1: Returning value
Assert.AreEqual(4, Square(2));

Example 2: Using Ref
float a = 2;  
Square(a);  
Assert.AreEqual(4, a);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to end this post with my oppinion on the "Ref" and "Out" keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although there are valid cases when the right solution is to use Ref and Out, from my experince I say you rarely need to use Out, and you need a really good reason for using Ref.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stage 0 - Ignorance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You used what? Never heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stage 1 - Awakening&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, I just learned how XYZ pattern can improve my design. I'm not really sure where it would work in my code, but I'm definitely looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stage 2 - Overzealous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally "get" the XYZ pattern; I'm adding it everywhere I can shoehorn it into m code. My design's gonna be better now, for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stage 3 - Mastery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After allowing the design to evolve throuhg interaction with the users and the addition of tests, it started to exhibit ABC negative characteristics, but the XYZ pattern was a logical next step and was achieved through a simple refactoring.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to start this article with the definition of what technical debt is. Technical debt is taking shortcuts for good or bad, for known or unknown reasons. The technical debt grows exponentially over time because of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt - Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of interest is based on a number of things, among others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of knowledge - Either from time passing and people forget stuff, or from people changing jobs, leave of absence, death etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increase in complexity - New functionality will be designed and implemented on top and according to existing technical debt, writing more code to get around code, with more code you need more tests and this code and tests needs review. Hence technical debt will increase technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to spot debt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some signs to look for when you go "debt spotting&amp;amp;" to make it easier to point technical debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code areas where you as a developer when assigned bugs or to extend this code feel your heart sink, your moral drop e.g spaghetti code, or unnecessary complexity, or if the intent of the code isn't clear enough so it has to use comments or regions as a crutch for relaying what it does&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average amounts of tasks per sprint decreases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of tests increases at the same time as "average amount of tasks/sprint decreases"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an agile project methodology you don&amp;#8217;t necessarily have a lower technical debt but because of its support for rapid changes the debt will be highlighted at an earlier stage allowing you to decide if to pay this debt or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience test driven development and tests in general protect you from some technical debt because you've had to go through the steps of "red", "green", "refactor"; and thereby paid a little of the debt up front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying debt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with any debt there is always an enforcer, a collector that will &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; you pay that debt. With technical debt, this collector is usually time, or new requirements.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the interest, paying the debt will be more and more expensive as time goes, until you are forced by time to pay, at its most latest stage. This is when its the most expensive to pay the debt because you are most prone to the interests of people with skills have moved on, system have changed, a lot of technical debt has been built and made dependent on underlying technical debt. The debt may even be so large so for you to be able to pay it your feature development will stagnate and may even lead to loss of market pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often project managers don't allow developers to pay technical debt, or don't prioritise it since its sometimes hard to motivate a sprint that starts with 12 tasks and ends with 12 tasks still to do, with the only thing the developers salary has paid is the debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Technical Debt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bugs are not technical debt until someone decides to not fix them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage technical debt = planned technical debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmanaged is the worst, this is only fixed when the pain is felt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Technical Debt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to monitor the debt, you must keep track of it. This involves keeping track of both the managed debt introduced on purpose using shortcuts, quick solutions and the "not-quite-right" solutions, and the unmanaged ones whenever they are encountered and grade them in some way that gives them a relational size difference. My personal view is that for every day that goes by of coding, it's very unlikely that the technical debt remains the same but instead rather if you don't pay some you gain some. Taking time into consideration, just a small daily increase will eventually become very expensive to pay off, leave it too long and a rewrite may end up being your only solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technical debt is like an iceberg with only 10 percent visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, keep track of that 10 percent for all your life's worth : )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (dictionary.ContainsKey(key))
{
  dictionary[key] = value;  
}
else
{
  dictionary.Add(key, value);  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can be substituted with the following with the same functionality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dictionary[key] = value;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code will be cleaner, functionality will be the same and a few operations faster :P&lt;/p&gt;

Mapping one type to another, be it server to client DTOs or something else, there are numerous ways of accomplishing it. Some use a static Mapper factory, some use tools like AutoMapper, my preferred way of doing it is with the use of Implicit Operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var domainModel = new DomainModel
{
    Firstname = "Firstname",
    Lastname = "Lastname"
};

ViewModel viewModel = domainModel;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What allows us to do this is something called an "Implicit Operator". Which are defined like below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private class ViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public static implicit operator ViewModel(DomainModel model)
    {
        return new ViewModel
        {
            Name = model.Firstname + " " + model.Lastname
        };
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!----&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private class DomainModel
{
    public string Firstname { get; set; }
    public string Lastname { get; set; }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.Sort(myList.ToArray());
foreach(var i in myList)
{ // Do something with i }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first though was “Wait what?” Is there some hidden functionality of List.ToArray() that I have missed which only is passed onto jedi masters? Does this way of sorting perform better than just List.Sort?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to investigate, so I wrote up this little code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var list = new List&amp;lt;int&amp;amp;gt; {9, 4, 7, 1, 2};

Array.Sort(list.ToArray());
foreach (var i in list)
{
   Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Console.ReadKey();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold the printed sequence is: 9 4 7 1 2, hence we are creating an array, sorting it then throwing it away, only to use our list in the foreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List.Sort uses Array.Sort internally so I would dare go out on a limb and say that speed for sorting should be the same&lt;/p&gt;
