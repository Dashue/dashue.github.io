			<a href="/2013/12/locking-made-easy/">Locking made easy</a> 
			<span>posted on 06 dec 2013</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>With todays increase in multithreaded solutions locking are more and more often becoming a requirement. Without a clear seperation between business code and locking code it's very easy to get locking wrong and end up with an tangled mess of code.</p>

<p>The most common issues I've seen with locking solutions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a Shared syncroot for multiple non-related data
<ul>
<li>Can lead to unnecessary and costly synchronization</li>
<li>Can lead to deadlocks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Having no visibility where locks are retrieved or set (i.e locks are acquired in multiple locations)
<ul>
<li>Leads to hard to read code</li>
<li>Can lead to deadlocks</li>
<li>Can lead to unlocked access of data </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>So to remedy this, I came up with a simple piece of base that I call LockBase:</p>

<pre><code>private readonly object _syncRoot;

    public LockBase()
    {
        _syncRoot = new object();
    }

    public void WithLock(Action action)
    {
        lock (_syncRoot)
        {
            action.Invoke();
        }
    }

    public T WithLock&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; action)
    {
        lock (_syncRoot)
        {
            return action.Invoke();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm mostly using this to build specific caches. Something along the lines of this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCache : LockBase
{
    private Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; _cache = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();

    public string Get(int key)
    {
        return WithLock(() =&gt; _cache[key]);
    }

    public void Set(int key, string value)
    {
        WithLock(() =&gt; _cache[key] = value);
    }

    public bool Contains(int key)
    {
        return WithLock(() =&gt; _cache.ContainsKey(key));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps</p>

			<a href="/2013/11/configurationsection-a-testable-and-dependable-configuration-solution/">ConfigurationSection &quot;A testable, dependable configuration solution&quot;</a> 
			<span>posted on 25 nov 2013</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>I wanted to share a way of handling application configuration that have helped me alot. It leverages <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.configuration.configurationsection(v=vs.110).aspx">ConfigurationSection</a> and gives you the possiblility to test-drive your application settings. Let's jump in!</p>

<h2>The basic scenario</h2>

<p>Given an App.Config file with the following contents. (<strong>Make sure you align the type property to your solution</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;configSections&gt;
        &lt;section name="MyConfiguration" type="My.Namespace.MyConfiguration, My.Assembly"/&gt;
    &lt;/configSections&gt;

    &lt;MyConfiguration Age="25" Name="Name" DayOfBirth="Monday" /&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In tdd fashion, let's start out with the test. Normally I would add one property at a time to get a short red-green cycle, but for the sake of keeping down the size of this post we will add all of them at once.</p>

<pre><code>[Fact]
public void ReadMyConfiguration()
{
    IMyConfiguration configuration = MyConfiguration.Get();

    Assert.Equal(25, configuration.Age);
    Assert.Equal("Name", configuration.Name);
    Assert.Equal(DayOfWeek.Monday, configuration.DayOfBirth);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For demonstration purpose we read a number, a string and an enumeration. Let's go ahead and specify what will be our contract: IMyConfiguration.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IMyConfiguration
{
    int Age { get; }
    string Name { get; }
    DayOfWeek DayOfBirth { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Heading back to the test we see that the only thing left to implement is the MyConfiguration class. Let's add the following implementation.</p>

<pre><code>public class MyConfiguration : ConfigurationSection, IMyConfiguration
{
    private MyConfiguration() {}

    public static IMyConfiguration Get()
    {
        return (IMyConfiguration)ConfigurationManager.GetSection("MyConfiguration");
    }

    [ConfigurationProperty("Age", IsRequired = true)]
    public int Age
    {
        get
        {
            return (int)this["Age"];
        }
    }

    [ConfigurationProperty("Name", IsRequired = true)]
    public string Name
    {
        get
        {
            return (string)this["Name"];
        }
    }

    [ConfigurationProperty("DayOfBirth", IsRequired = true)]
    public DayOfWeek DayOfBirth
    {
        get
        {
            return (DayOfWeek)this["DayOfBirth"];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We make the default constructor private to expose only one way of instantiating the class. This step should leave you with a passing test.</p>

<h3>Enums</h3>

<p>Did you notice how cleanly the enumeration was supplied to us, no explicit calls to TryParse needed. What's also nice is that we get descriptive feedback if we were to misstype the value of an enum. For example changing the DateOfBirth to be misspellt "Mnoday" gives the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>The value of the property 'DayOfBirth' cannot be parsed. 
The error is: The enumeration value must be one of the following: 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
</code></pre>

<h3>Required</h3>

<p>We will also be given an exception for any missing properties that are marked as required.</p>

<pre><code>Required attribute 'Age' not found.
</code></pre>

<h2>Moving on to the marginally more advanced stuff</h2>

<h3>Multiple Values</h3>

<p>Sometimes storing and fetching individual values are not enough and the usage of lists of values are required. Leveraging the configuration section approach makes it really simple.</p>

<p>The following is my preferred way of storing multiple values, it's quick and simple.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;MyConfiguration MyStrings="value1,value2,value3" /&gt;

[ConfigurationProperty("MyStrings", IsRequired = true)]
[TypeConverter(typeof(CommaDelimitedStringCollectionConverter))]
public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; MyStrings
{
    get
    {
        return ((CommaDelimitedStringCollection)this["MyStrings"]).Cast&lt;string&gt;();
    }
}   
</code></pre>

<h3>TypeConverters</h3>

<p>Did you notice the use of the TypeConverter of type <strong>CommaDelimitedStringCollectionConverter</strong> in the previous example? This is just one of many converters provided by the framework. The following is a list of all the converters I was able to find. I'll leave it up to you to tinker around and figure out which ones can be useful to your configurations.</p>

<ul>
<li>ArrayConverter</li>
<li>BooleanConverter</li>
<li>ByteConverter</li>
<li>CharConverter</li>
<li>CollectionConverter</li>
<li>CommaDelimitedStringCollectionConverter</li>

		<p>Having tried hosting my blog on tumblr, my own wordpress instance and wordpress online I've never been really happy. To me, writing should be simple and easy, so when I first heard of Sandra.Snow: A solution to freely host your blog on github pages with full control over everything, I jumped on it!</p>

<p>First thing I had to do was migrate my original posts (html) off of wordpress. The other people using Sandra.Snow that I know of created a Wordpress export file and manually started to migrate posts over. I on the other hand claimed "Why spend 2 hours of manual labour when I can spend two weeks to automate the process". In hindsight not the best approach :) , but from it were two open source solutions born:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlToMarkdown.Net/">Html To Markdown.Net</a>  <em>(Apparently this didn´t exist already)</em><br />
<a href="https://github.com/Dashue/FromWordpressToSandraSnow">From Wordpress To Sandra.Snow</a></p>

<p>So in the following days I will continue to sanity-check old posts and publish them here.<br />

			<a href="/2012/02/a-few-caveats-when-using-strings-in-net/">A few caveats when using Strings in .Net</a> 
			<span>posted on 23 feb 2012</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>Strings in .Net are class objects and unlike value types they are stored on the heap.</p>

<p>According to msdn: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee787088.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Garbage collection occurs when one of the following conditions is true:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>The system has low physical memory.</li>
  <li>The memory that is used by allocated objects on the managed heap surpasses an acceptable threshold. This means that a threshold of acceptable memory usage has been exceeded on the managed heap. This threshold is continuously adjusted as the process runs.</li>
  <li>The GC.Collect  method is called. In almost all cases, you do not have to call this method, because the garbage collector runs continuously. This method is primarily used for unique situations and testing.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to the second condition creating a string object can trigger garbage collection, which is costly in terms of performance. As developers we want to keep the string creation to a minimum. Since strings in .Net are immutable (manipulation results in a the creation of a new instance) means that combining two strings "string1" + "string2" results in the creation of three strings and editing a string results in creating a new one with the modification.</p>

<p>I think it's good to have the knowledge about how things work and why even though it's considered an micro optimization.</p>

			<a href="/2012/02/why-youd-want-to-place-a-shared-library-in-its-own/">Why you'd want to place a shared library in its own solution</a> 
			<span>posted on 18 feb 2012</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>A situation occurred on work where we decided to refactor duplicated funtionality from two project (A and B) into a new shared library (X) DRYing things up. During this process the question of where to put X came up. I quickly answered "It's own solution" whereupon my colleague countered with the very simple yet valid question "Why" and I answered "Because" thinking it was really obvious and at the time couldn't understand why he'd even ask.</p>

<p>After work I realized this was a childish and not a very helpful answer caused by me just knowing it was a good thing to do and have never reflected upon the reason for it. So I decided to gather my thoughts and write this blog giving a better answer to his valid question.</p>

<h3>Presumptions</h3>

<ul>
<li>We will use internal Nuget feed for the library.</li>
<li>X could be placed in either A or B or separate library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Consuming the Library</h3>

<p>Placing it in its own solution forces all projects consume it the same way, otherwise some projects would use nuget and one could use project reference. </p>

<h3>Future Changes</h3>

<p>If placed in A it would be easy to change according to requirement or quick fix for A and not think about B or any future consumers. Placing it in its own solution forces it to behave more like an independent library and less like a project reference. It makes more sense to open the solution for the library when change is needed than to open an unrelated solution containing the library.</p>

<h3>Unrelated Functionality</h3>

<p>Since the functionality is general and not related to neither A nor B, placing it in the same solution just because it's consumed by them is not a valid argument.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>

<p>The library has different release/deploy cycles than the consumers and using Nuget allows for choosing what version and if/when to upgrade. Different consumers can easily consume different versions of the library. </p>

<h3>YAGNI</h3>

<p>YAGNI was mentioned as an argument against placing X in its own library. I think developers are to fast to throw abbreviations as arguments thinking they are valid without actually considering the situation at hand, but this is material for a future post.</p>

			<span>posted on 25 jan 2012</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>I was investigating why my hobby project <a href="https://github.com/Dashue/MediaOrganizer">"PhotoUtil"</a> was being slow.
A program that takes a folder with a bunch of photos as inputs, processes the metadata from them, more specifically the date the picture was taken and then organizes them in folders based on this.</p>

<p>Following is a short recap of that procedure.</p>

<h3>Find out what's taking time 1: Analyze / Launch Performance Wizard</h3>

<p>The first thing that popped out at me was a DateTime creation which took 100% of the CPU time (according to the performance report). I grab the DateTimeOriginal value from exif metadata of a photo and convert it into datetime, only because it allowed for cleaner code when accessing the date and time values later on in the code. Apparently parsing strings into datetime is slow, so instead I got it to work with some string manipulation.</p>

<h3>Find out what's taking time 2: Analyze / Launch Performance Wizard</h3>

<p>When reading exif data using GDI+ from a file the whole image is read into memory using new Bitmap(Path); then the desired properties are fetched using GetProperty. This made me switch focus to increasing concurrent files being worked on (read parallelization) instead of minimizing process time of each file. With this in mind I rewrote my foreach loop into using the parallel library.</p>

<p>from</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var filepath in filepaths)
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>Parallel.ForEach(filePaths, oldFilePath); 
</code></pre>

<h3>Taking it one step further:</h3>

<p>After finding out that the whole image is read into memory I set out to find an alternate approach of extracting EXIF data from a photo. It wasn't long before I found a sweet project called <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36342/ExifLib-A-Fast-Exif-Data-Extractor-for-NET-2-0">ExifLib</a> on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExifLib/">Nuget</a> which only reads the Exif data portion of an image. ExifLib is a wonderful lib created by Simon McKenzie only available as source code from codeproject.com but I'm hoping to convince him to put it up on NuGet so more people can find and make use of it.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>100 images processed on an Intel Core 2 duo</p>

<pre><code>Before optimizations:   00:00:20.8059121  
After optimizations:    00:00:11:4034511
Using ExifLib:          00:00:01.0714248

<p>Writing a complete test suite naturally leads to good design, enforcing low coupling and high cohesion.</p>

			<a href="/2012/01/review-tfs-11-the-things-i-look-forward-to/">Review TFS 11: The things I look forward to</a> 
			<span>posted on 13 jan 2012</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>With TFS 11 around the corner (with in-place upgrade from 2010), having been rewritten with the promise of a faster and smarter experience I felt like compiling a list of the features I look forward to the most. Ordered by pain factor solving desc.</p>

<h3>Automerge content changes (finally)</h3>

<p>Finally TFS has come to it&#8217;s senses and allows for automerge of non-conflicting content changes. </p>

<h3>My work pane and Search work items</h3>

<p>No need for custom work item queries, work related to you will be easily available in the work item pane. Searching for items is also available here.</p>

<h3>Easier to transition between work items states</h3>

<p>No more open work item and changing state to in progress, just right-click item in my work pane and click start.</p>

<h3>Suspending</h3>

<p>Easier task switching by using suspend/resume. Saves visual studio state, open files and position in currently open file. Suspended tasks are listed in you work pane.</p>

<h3>New Pending changes page</h3>

<p>Shows tree of pending changes. Allows or leaving files in excluded state without having to exclude changes every check-in (good for personalized web.config etc.).</p>

<h3>New built-in diff tool</h3>

<p>TFS team has finally gotten around to fix the built in diff tool, which now supports more view modes and reflects live changes. Which means diff will update if you make changes to your version when showing base/yours. The merge tool has also gotten some love.</p>

<h3>Local workspaces</h3>

<p>Removes offline mode, and the time out method require to go offline. Doesn&#8217;t handle modified files by reading the read-only bit on the file (Took them until 2012 to fix it). File system watcher watch for change made outside of VS, and lists them nicely in the pending changes pane.</p>

<h3>Shelving</h3>

<p>Shelveset merge (with current and baseless) and searching of shelvesets.</p>

<h3>Code Review workflow</h3>

<p>Request code-review workflow on suspended changeset or checked in changeset as well as code reviewing functionality with the ability to comment on specific changes and even alter the changeset.</p>

<h3>Rollback changesets</h3>

<p>Awesome</p>

<h3>Async operations</h3>

<p>Modality and blocking operations has now been removed, no more waiting on visual studio to complete retrieving things (search items etc.).</p>

<h3>New Builds page</h3>

<p>Shows builds associated to me (started by me etc.). Extensible</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>

<p>I really like the new way that TFS 11 shows data; putting the concept of "My work" in focus, showing my work items and my builds etc. This combined with the new functionalities provided, working in TFS 11 will be much more smother and faster than it's predecessors and I am really looking forward til it's released and part of my development environment.</p>

		<p>I just stumbled upon Enumerable.Zip which is a newly added Linq operator since .NET Framework 4.</p>

<p>Signature is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public static IEnumerable&lt;TResult&gt; Zip&lt;TFirst, TSecond, TResult&gt;(
    this IEnumerable&lt;TFirst&gt; first,
    IEnumerable&lt;TSecond&gt; second,
    Func&lt;TFirst, TSecond, TResult&gt; func);
</code></pre>

<p>Much like a zipper it "zips" together two IEnumerables applying a specified function over each pair of elements.
I've seen examples which print the greater number from two list of ints, which constructs addresses from four lists of city/street/number/flatnumber and one that prints name and age from name/age lists.</p>

<p>I have as of yet found a good real world example, and am incapable of thinking one up.<br />
Anyone out there who have made good use of this added functionality?</p>

			<span>posted on 11 jan 2012</span>
		</h1> 
		
		<p>A good friend of mine asked me to share my thoughts on the ref keyword so here goes.</p>

<p>To give it some context: To me a good method is a function taking a variable amount of parameters, making some processing and possibly returning the result. Furthermore the method should do one thing and one thing only and never change input parameter values.</p>

<p>Now the ref keyword allow developers to stray from this "ideal" method by allowing it to change the values of the input parameters. Obfuscating the self-documentation of the method and by this diffusing what the method does and what it's single responsibility is. This creates a required understanding by your fellow colleagues about the intricates of the method, and in turn requires every developer to know how every method in the system is implemented.</p>

<p>The most common reason for using ref parameters is simply that your method is doing to much, rendering you unable to return a single value/collection to account for everything that is being done, ending up with sending and object as input parameter and changing a lot of values. This may be improved by returning part of the data as an out parameter and part of it as the return value if possible.</p>

<p>The reason why I think that using out is better than ref is because out doesn't obfuscate the api and the intention of the method. Using Ref conveys that "This method might(?) change values of the parameter or even the parameter itself" while Out conveys that "This method will change the parameter".</p>

<p>Consider these two implementations of this contrived example:</p>

<pre><code>Example 1: Returning value
Assert.AreEqual(4, Square(2));

Example 2: Using Ref
float a = 2;  
Square(a);  
Assert.AreEqual(4, a);
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to end this post with my oppinion on the "Ref" and "Out" keywords.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although there are valid cases when the right solution is to use Ref and Out, from my experince I say you rarely need to use Out, and you need a really good reason for using Ref.</p>
